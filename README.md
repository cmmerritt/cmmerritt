## About me

- Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - An email signature generator that mismatches inspirational quotes and sources, plus a theme-appropriate gif, complete with HTML to plug in to your email client for an instant signature. Tired of misattributed quotes? If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Think: "Do or do not. There is no try. -Socrates"
  - Learning the Godot engine and GDScript to create games
- Pronouns: She/Her/Hers 
- Fun fact: I designed and knit a red Star Trek command uniform for my cat. She did not appreciate it.

## Skills

### My Email Signature

Solo project built using Remix with TypeScript, plus MaterialUI. Inspired by misattributed quotes in email signatures -- generate a real quote (via a quote API) with a randomly attributed author, plus a thematic GIF (via Giphy). Get HTML you can paste into your email app to display your new signature and GIF.

### Soup Swap

Built using Next.js and TypeScript with a group of friends over a two-week sprint, Soup Swap helps you plan and organize soup swaps. My contributions were on the back end, creating a database to store users, groups, and recipes, and using supabase to provide authentication and authorization.

### Postcat

Solo project built with React, cloning basic Postman API testing functionality, with a cat sidekick.
